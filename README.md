# Plural Viewpoints

## What is this?
This is a tool that provides an opportunity for people to observe
world from plural viewpoints. A single question posed by a human is
answered by three virtual personalities with different ideologies.

There is a Japanese proverb that says, "[When three people gather, divine wisdom emerges.](https://scrapbox.io/nishio-en/When_three_people_gather,_devine_wisdom_emerges)"
Good wisdom can be gained when three people with different
perspectives come together to think.

## How to use
(You can ask a question to the virtual personalities. The virtual
personalities will answer your question from their own perspectives.
You can also see the consensus of the virtual personalities.)

Ideally, in the future, users will be able to pitch their topics of
interest to multiple virtual personalities. For the sake of AI
execution cost, I am currently showing the output executed at my end.

## About Consensus
This system does not use majority rule by voting. Consensus is reached
when all three respondents are in the same direction, and weak
consensus when some are neutral.

## What is "Political Ideologies for the 21st Century"
["Political Ideologies for the 21st Century"](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/political-ideologies-for-the-21st-century/)
is a blog entry written by E. Glen Weyl. In this blog entry, he
talks about three political ideologies that are emerging in the 21st
century.

I find this concept to be very valuable when thinking about the future
of society, but on the other hand, I feel it's challenging to
explain and make people understand it in words. That's why
I'm creating this web service that people can experience.

## What is "MAGI System"
The ["MAGI System"](https://scrapbox.io/nishio-en/MAGI_System)
is a fictional supercomputer system from the Japanese science
fiction anime "Neon Genesis Evangelion." It consists of
three independent but interconnected supercomputers, and each
supercomputer represents a different aspect of human thought.

It inspired me to create this web service.
