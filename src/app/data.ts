        text: "Yes, businesses can play a significant role in solving social problems, often with greater efficiency than governments, due to their ability to innovate rapidly, allocate resources efficiently, and leverage technological advancements. Unlike government entities, which may be hampered by bureaucratic processes and political considerations, businesses are driven by goals, results, and the need to stay competitive. This drive can lead to the development of innovative solutions to social challenges, such as poverty, education, and healthcare. Furthermore, businesses can apply their expertise in project management and efficiency to implement solutions at scale more quickly. However, it's important to recognize that while businesses can contribute significantly to addressing social problems, their efforts must complement those of governments. The most effective solutions often come from collaborative efforts that leverage the strengths of both sectors, ensuring that social initiatives are not only innovative and efficient but also equitable and accessible to all segments of society.",

        text: "Yes. Businesses, particularly those driven by a clear vision and innovative spirit, often possess the agility, efficiency, and creativity needed to address social problems in ways that governments, by their nature, cannot. Governments are typically constrained by bureaucratic processes, political considerations, and the need to balance diverse interests, which can slow down decision-making and the implementation of solutions. In contrast, businesses can leverage market mechanisms, cutting-edge technology, and entrepreneurial approaches to develop and scale solutions rapidly. For instance, private companies have been at the forefront of advancements in renewable energy, providing affordable and sustainable alternatives to traditional energy sources, significantly contributing to the fight against climate change. Additionally, businesses can bring a level of specialization and expertise to problem-solving that is hard for government bodies to match, enabling more targeted and innovative solutions. That said, while businesses can drive significant progress in solving social problems, their efforts should complement, rather than replace, the essential role of governments in ensuring equity, protecting public interests, and addressing issues that lack a clear market incentive.",

        text: "STRONG NO. While businesses play a crucial role in innovation and can offer solutions to social problems, relying on them solely overlooks the fundamental responsibilities of governments and the unique advantages they hold. Governments are mandated to prioritize the public good over profit, ensuring that solutions to social problems are accessible to all, not just to those who can afford them. Moreover, government interventions can address systemic issues through policy, regulation, and direct support, areas where businesses might not have the necessary leverage or motivation. This stance is rooted in the principle of digital democracy, emphasizing that digital tools and innovations should be leveraged by governments to enhance transparency, citizen participation, and equitable access to services. Businesses can be vital partners in this endeavor, but the ultimate responsibility for solving social problems in a manner that promotes equality and the common good should reside with democratically elected institutions.",
